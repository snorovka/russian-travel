          <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
            but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their native country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home?
            In fact, Russia is a whole universe with a gentle sea of the south, dense forests of the Sayan Mountains
            and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions on your account,
            international passports and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova — a brave young mother,
            who took three children in her arms, put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers around her native country.
            We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

              <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
                First of all, because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
                And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places — the mountain air.</p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in summer.
                So you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges,
                and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

              <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skioring competitions.
                This is a kind of sport when a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much as possible
                speed on the ice. In March 2019, a world record was set at the Baikal Mile Festival — 197.011 km/h.</p>

                because of the impassable swamps, they never knew the axe. Some pine trees are already more than half a millennium old.
                Touch a living being who saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
                In the virgin forest, you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on the rare paths there are trees
                a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
