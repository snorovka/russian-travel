          <h2 class="intro__title">There is enough to see in Russia</h2>
          <p class="intro__text">According to the Russian Public Opinion Centre (WCIOM), only 36% of Russian citizens plan to spend
             their holidays in Russia. And 95% of Russians dream of travelling abroad, saying: 'what haven't we seen here — been there,
             done it'. In fact, Russia is a whole new world with a soft sea in the south, dense forests of the Sayan Mountains
            and arctic ice of the Putorana plateau in the north. And what makes it even more attractive is that to visit those places
            you don't have to be a millionaire, you don't need an international passport and you don't have to be on a plane for hours.
            Take for example Vera Bashmakova — a very brave young mother of three, who took her children, got them into her car
            and drove for 20 thousand kilometers across Russia. Here we have selected a few interesting places worthy of your vacation that
            you will never forget.</p>

                and from apatites, apathy has been covering you for a long time. But your dream of seeing the Northern Lights begins to come true with a ticket

              <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
                First of all, because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
                And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places — the mountain air.</p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in summer.
                So you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges,
                and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

              <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skioring competitions.
                This is a kind of sport when a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much as possible
                speed on the ice. In March 2019, a world record was set at the Baikal Mile Festival — 197.011 km/h.</p>

                because of the impassable swamps, they never knew the axe. Some pine trees are already more than half a millennium old.
                Touch a living being who saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
                In the virgin forest, you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on the rare paths there are trees
                a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
